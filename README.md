# Titanic Survival Analysis and Prediction (Work-in-Progress)
Machine learning project analysing and predicting survival on the Titanic (work in progress entry for Kaggle Competition)

## Project Overview
This repository hosts my ongoing machine learning project, currently in draft form, focused on analysing and predicting passenger survival on the RMS Titanic. As a work-in-progress entry in the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), the project utilises passenger data such as age, sex, and ticket class to predict survival outcomes. Regular updates and improvements are expected as the project evolves.


## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Titanic dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It includes various features such as passenger names, ages, classes, and survival status.

## Files in the Repository
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and modeling.
- `train.csv`: Training dataset provided by Kaggle.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset provided by Kaggle.
- `gender_submission.csv`: Kaggle's example submission file for understanding the required format.
- `submission.csv`: My draft submission.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Methodology
The project follows these main steps:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset's features and distributions.
2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Handling missing values and categorical data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to better capture the predictive power of the data.
4. **Model Building**: Implementing various machine learning algorithms to predict survival.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of models and fine-tuning their parameters.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning

## How to Run the Project
To run this project, clone the repository, install the required packages, and open `titanic_analysis.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
